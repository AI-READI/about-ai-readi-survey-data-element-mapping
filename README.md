Good afternoon. 
In large health cohort studies, we collect hundreds of survey items from many instruments to capture social, behavioral, and clinical factors. While valuable, this diversity creates a big problem: heterogeneous questionnaire structures make data reuse and cross-study analyses difficult. Our goal was to break down that barrier with a reproducible way to harmonize survey data into a common, widely adopted data model.
We chose the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model, or OMOP CDM, as our harmonization target. To ground our work, we used the AI-READI study as an exemplar. AI-READI is part of the NIH Bridge2AI initiative and collected participant-reported data from 47 validated and custom survey instruments across 3,574 participants. The question was not just to map data points, but to do it in a way that is traceable, reusable, and scalable.
Our solution rests on a governance-based semantic harmonization workflow. In practice, this means a transparent process that governs how every survey element is mapped, who approves it, and how changes are tracked. We then translated each survey item into a paired question–response representation and documented it with the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings, or SSSOM. This creates a machine-readable, auditable trail from the original instrument to the harmonized OMOP concept.
A key achievement was mapping 2,004 survey data elements to OMOP concepts. For elements that could not be mapped directly, we implemented AI-READI vocabulary extensions to preserve their meaning and keep them usable for analysis.
The result is a scalable framework that enables interoperable analytics and AI-ready research by integrating patient-reported data into OMOP. It’s not just a one-off effort—the approach is generalizable to other cohorts and instruments, helping to unlock cross-cohort studies and faster discovery.
